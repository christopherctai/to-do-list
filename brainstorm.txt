Requirements:  
-have to-do items with title, description, dueDate, priority 
-projects or separate lists of todos 
-a default project where all the initial todos go
-users should be able to create new projects and choose which projects the todos go into 
-user interface: 
--view all projects 
--view all todos in each project (just title and duedate and color for priorities) 
--expand a todo to see/edit details 
--delete a todo 

Important notes: 
-separate your application logic (ie, creating new todos, setting them as complete, changing priority, etc.) from your DOM-related stuff that gets DOM stuff and changes it
